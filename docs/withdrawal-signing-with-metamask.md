### Signing Withdrawal Transaction with Metamask

When you are trying to withdraw your CKB or sUDT from L2 to L1, you may find the `Sign` button on Metamask is grey and not clickable. You have to click the small downside arraw in Metamask first, then the `Sign` button will become blue and clickable.
